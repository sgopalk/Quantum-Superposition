# Quantum Superposition in 1D Box

An interactive Streamlit app for visualizing the time evolution of a quantum particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The simulation demonstrates the superposition of energy eigenstates and illustrates wavefunction collapse upon measurement.
# Features

- Choose number of eigenstates to include in the superposition.
- Set quantum number 'n' and complex coefficient 'c' for each state.
- Real-time animation of the probability density.
- Option to capture snapshots and observe wavefunction collapse.

## Installation
